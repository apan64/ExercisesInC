My learning goal for this class is to understand how to use C to perform lower-level operations, and how to properly structure the creation of software.

For our team's population of our sprint backlog, we worked together to compile a list of resources that we should read over the course of this sprint to gain knowledge about the topic we wanted to work on.  We archived items from our backlog as we decided that they were no longer necessary, and continued to add items that we discovered a need for after discussing each item with the team.  We also brainstormed a list of project ideas and voted on them through Trello.  Our team had a member that volunteered to be the scrum master, but for now we are collectively working on reading up on resources that we believe would help us create our project.  I am not apprehensive about anything at the moment, because our project's scope can be changed easily in the event that we work slower or faster than expected.
