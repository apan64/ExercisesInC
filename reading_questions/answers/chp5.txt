Chapter 5

Because 128 in 8-bit unsigned would be 10000000, converting to a 16-bit and applying sign extension would produce 1111111110000000, because the 8-bit was unsigned but had the leftmost value as a one, sign extension copies that value to all new added bits.

12 ^ 255 + 1 for 8-bit

Using bias instead of a sign bit or two's complement saves an additional bit that can be used for storing a value instead of signing the exponent.

11000001010100000000000000000000, if interpreted as an integer, this value would be 3243245568
