Memory encompasses RAM and is what is used for actively running programs and processes, while storage is where data is read from or written to for long-term storage.

A GiB is the binary byte number for storage (2**30), whereas GB is the base-10 number of bytes (10**9)

The virtual memory system ensures that processes all have their own allocated amount of memory through the addressing system.

The stack and heap are the only dynamic sections of memory that are still changing during run-time, so by keeping them at opposite ends of the address space they will not be overwriting each other as they continue to grow.

The python data structure I would use would be a dictionary, as it could handle the same functions as an associative table and the time for a lookup is fast.

A context switch is the mechanism that allows the operating system to be running a process with system resources, and quickly interrupting it and running another process instead.
