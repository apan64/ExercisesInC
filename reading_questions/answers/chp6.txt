Chapter 6

I would expect free to take constant time, while calloc takes time proportional to the size of the chunk.  Malloc and realloc are dependent on the number of free chunks.

Attempting to access memory that has been freed will cause a segmentation fault.

Writing a value to an unallocated chunk could overwrite other data structures such as the ones used for malloc and free

Reading from a freed chunk (now unallocated memory) will cause a segmentation fault

Writing to a freed chunk (now unallocated memory) could overwrite other data structures such as the ones used for malloc and free

Failing to free a chunk that is no longer needed could cause the process to run out of memory to allocate (memory leak)

compiz and Firefox are using the most memory on my system

Allocating a large number of small chunks is bad because the minimum size of a chunk is 16 bytes on many systems, so there ends up being a lot of wasted memory that could be saved by instead allocating small structures inside of arrays.
